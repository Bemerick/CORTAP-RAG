Summary of Findings\n........................................................................................................................... 15\nVI. Attendees\nVII. Appendices\nI. Executive Summary\nThis report documents the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s (FTA) Triennial Review of the\nNorwalk Transit District (NTD) of Norwalk, Connecticut. The FTA wants to ensure that awards\nare administered in accordance with the requirements of Federal public transportation law\n49 U.S.C. Chapter 53. The review was performed by Qi Tech, LLC. During the virtual site visit,\nthe reviewer discussed the administrative and statutory requirements and reviewed recipient\ndocuments.\nDue to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency, the FTA conducted a\nvirtual site visit for this Triennial Review. In addition, the FTA expanded the review to address\nNTD\u2019s compliance with the administrative relief and flexibilities that the FTA granted, and the\nrequirements of the COVID-19 Relief funds received through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security (CARES) Act, Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental\nAppropriations Act (CRRSAA) of 2021, and the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021. The\nFTA also requested that NTD share if and/or how it suspended, deviated from, or significantly\nupdated or altered its transit program due to the public health emergency.\nThe FY2023 Triennial Review focused on NTD\u2019s compliance in 23 areas. Deficiencies related to\nthe COVID-19 Relief funds have been clearly identified as part of the deficiency description in\nthe respective review area. There were no repeat deficiencies from the FY 2019 Triennial\nReview.\nA deficiency was found in the area listed below.\nDeficiencies\nReview Area\nCode Description\nDisadvantaged Business\nDBE12-2 Insufficient documentation of monitoring DBE work\nEnterprise\n2023 Triennial Review \u2013 Norwalk Transit District 1 | 15\nII. Review Background and Process\n1. Background\nThe Triennial Review includes a review of the recipient\u2019s compliance in 23 areas. The basic\nrequirements for each of these areas are summarized in Section IV. The FTA contracts with\nexperienced reviewers to lead and conduct the Triennial Reviews, in partnership with the staff of\nthe regional office.\nThis report presents the findings from the Triennial Review of the recipient. The review\nconcentrated on procedures and practices employed since the recipient\u2019s previous Triennial\nReview in 2019; however, coverage was extended to earlier periods as needed to assess the\npolicies in place and the management of award funds. The specific documents reviewed and\nreferenced in this report are available at the FTA\u2019s Region 1 office or the recipient\u2019s office.\n2. Process\nThe Triennial Review includes a pre-review assessment, a desk review and scoping meeting with\nthe FTA regional office, and a site visit to the recipient\u2019s location. Due to the COVID-19 Public\nHealth Emergency, a virtual site visit was conducted of each recipient. In addition, the review\nwas expanded to address the recipient\u2019s compliance with the administrative relief and\nflexibilities FTA granted and the requirements of the COVID-19 relief funds received through\nthe CARES Act, CRRSAA of 2021, and the ARP Act of 2021.The FTA also requested that the\nrecipient share if and/or how it suspended, deviated from, or significantly updated or altered its\ntransit program due to the public health emergency.\nThe fiscal year (FY) 2023 process began with the regional office transmitting a notification of\nthe review and a Recipient Information Request (RIR) to the recipient on November 23, 2022,\nindicating a review would be conducted. While the recipient prepared its response to the RIR, the\nregional office and review team conducted the scoping meeting on February 24 and 27, 2023.\nRegional office staff provided electronic files as necessary to the reviewers who also accessed\nrecipient information in the FTA electronic award management (TrAMS) and oversight (OTrak)\nsystems. Following the desk review and scoping meeting, the reviewer and the recipient\ncorresponded and exchanged information and documentation in preparation for the virtual site\nvisit. Prior to the virtual site visit, the reviewer sent to the recipient on April 19, 2023, an agenda\npackage indicating the issues that would be discussed, records to be reviewed, and interviews to\nbe conducted.\nThe virtual site visit portion of the review began with an entrance conference on March 28, 2023,\nat which the reviewers and regional staff discussed the purpose of the Triennial Review and the\nreview process. The reviewers conducted additional interviews and reviewed documentation to\nevidence the recipient\u2019s compliance with FTA requirements.\nUpon completion of the virtual site visit, the reviewers and the FTA regional office staff\nprovided a summary of preliminary findings to the recipi"
