      "description": "Per FTA Circular 9030.1E, Ch. III, Section 8c. Use of Program Income as Local Share, \"In a grant application requesting operating assistance, the applicant must deduct farebox revenues from operating costs to arrive at the net project cost of an operating assistance project. See Appendix C, 'Operating Assistance Projects,' of this circular for assistance in calculating the net project cost of a grant requesting operating assistance. Recipients must represent all funds used to cover eligible operating expenses in the worksheet. This category includes public transportation farebox revenues.\" NVCOG was awarded operating assistance for the first time in award CT-2020-007-01 CARES Act Relief for NVCOG-Valley Transit District. The reviewer requested documentation to support three ECHO draws made on June 17, 2020 ($331,986), June 30, 2020 ($135,706), and May 20, 2021 ($48,656). The initial review of the operating expense documentation provided for the three ECHO draws from that award did not contain any deduction for farebox revenue, other revenues, or operating subsidy from the state of Connecticut normally provided to the Valley Transit District to provide ADA and Dial-a-Ride services. Subsequently, NVCOG provided annualized financial documentation for January 20, 2020 through June of 2022 that contained revenues from farebox, contracts, other sources, and the Human Services contract revenue from CTDOT. The result of a review of that information indicates the recipient drew down FTA CARES Act Operating Assistance funds in excess of net operating expenses at the time of the three draws noted above.",
