All four procurements reviewed were missing a required federal clause: 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. LRTA was not aware that it was a required federal clause. Improper sealed bid procedures used (P8-4): The Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200.320 and FTA Circular 4220.1F require FTA recipients to follow specific procedures when conducting sealed bid procurements. During the review period, LRTA issued an Invitation for Bid (IFB) to replace bus shelters and the ticket/information booth at the Kennedy Bus Hub. Initially, LRTA did not intend to use FTA funds for the project. However, there was a small amount of funds remaining in an older FTA award, and this project met the scope of the award, so $11,733 in FTA funds were applied to the project after it had already been awarded to a contractor that had certified non-compliance with Buy America. LRTA did not follow its written procedures for IFB procurements.",

For this review, the December 2020, June 2021, and December 2022 semi-annual reports, as found in TrAMS, were examined to assess the accuracy of the data entries. During the virtual site visit, LRTA acknowledged the December 2020, June 2021, and December 2022 semi-annual reports were not accurate because the reports did not include all the FTA-funded contracts noted in their procurement list and LRTA did not include the on-call contracts. The FTA dollar value missing from the three reports is $1,109,634.16. This is a repeat deficiency from LRTA's FY 2016 and FY 2019 Triennial Reviews.",

Furthermore, during this review period, FTA provided guidance on its website pertaining to temporary service reductions due to issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Those guidelines state that a temporary service reduction as a result of an emergency is by definition not a 'major reduction in service' unless it lasts longer than a year or otherwise becomes permanent. Therefore, recipients must follow their public comment process for service reductions when the service reduction has exceeded one year. LRTA was forced to reduce service effective January 3, 2022, due to a shortage of bus drivers. It increased wages and provided incentives, so the agency hoped that the reduced service would be temporary. However, at the time of the virtual site visit, LRTA was still experiencing a bus driver shortage, and its service was still reduced. LRTA did not realize that it was required to implement its public comment process for major service reductions.",
