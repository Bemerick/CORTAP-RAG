FTA expects that the preventive maintenance (PM) intervals on federally funded assets will occur at least 80-percent on time. The reviewer selected four facility components from MTA's bus garage for a PM interval review. MTA was not able to provide documentation that that it was performing monthly PM inspections on the HVAC system or the overhead doors, as stated in its maintenance plan. MTA staff stated that the PMs were conducted, but they were not documented.",

By January 31, 2024, MTA must also submit a monthly report signed by the chief executive officer or other senior management designee on the PM results of the HVAC system and overhead doors until the data demonstrates MTA has conducted 80-percent of its monthly PMs on time for three consecutive months. For both the HVAC system and overhead doors, the recipient must include with the submittal to the FTA regional office: A report listing the items, the dates the inspections are due, and the dates of the actual inspections. List the percentage of the inspections performed on time. Back-up documentation for each item (e.g., copy of work order, printout from the maintenance management system) documenting the date of the inspection.",

However, the federal regulations at 2 CFR 200.324 and FTA Circular 4220.1F, Chapter VI require recipients to conduct an ICE as a tool to assist in determining the reasonableness of the bid or proposal being evaluated; that is, to assist in performing the cost or price analysis after bids or proposals are received.",
