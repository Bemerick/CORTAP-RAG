The plan did not include inspection cycles for preventive maintenance or procedures for pursuit of warranty claims. Radford Transit's contract with RTW clearly states what is required in the contractor's maintenance plan. However, Radford Transit did not review the plan to ensure it met FTA requirements. Additionally, Radford Transit does not receive regular reports on the contractor's maintenance activities and has not been monitoring these activities for compliance.",

Specifically, the procurement policies and procedures provided clearly define micro and small purchase thresholds and the requirements for conducting each of these methods of procurement. Radford Transit instead included three separate procurement actions in a single procurement that it determined to be available from a sole source. The file contents show that these were three distinctly separate purchases; two (2) micro purchases and one (1) small purchase that were completed with two different vendors. The file contents also show that quotes were received from two vendors for each of these purchases, clearly indicating that these purchases were not sole source procurements.",
