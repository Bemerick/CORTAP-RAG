In the reports of DBE participation to the Department (FTA), you must display both commitments and attainments. For this review, the semi-annual reports for December 2021 and June 2022 were examined to assess the accuracy of the data entries. The semi-annual reports were reviewed against MEVA's 2019-2022 procurement list. The semi-annual report discrepancies were: (1) a contract in the amount $1,169,987 was in the December 2021 semi-annual report, however, the actual contract record was not found on the procurement list; (2) a construction contract was awarded on January 21, 2022 in the amount of $2,482,387, however, the contract award was not included in the June 2022 semi-annual report; and (3) a service contract awarded in August 2022 in the amount of $1,045,387 was on the procurement list but not included in the December 2022 semi-annual report. In addition, the semi-annual reports for June 2019 through December 2022 incorrectly included the payment made to subcontractors as new awards. DBE5-1 is a repeat finding from both the FY 2016 and FY 2019 Triennial Reviews.",
