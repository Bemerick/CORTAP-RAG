The Transit Program Manager stated that the monthly inspections and semi-annual HVAC/Plumbing inspections were carried out. However, as a result of staffing vacancies, the agency was never able to implement the full (semi-annual and annual) facility inspections. Per FTA C. 5010.1E Ch. IV 4(n)(4), recipients must follow manufacturers' recommendations for PM inspections for all FTA-funded assets. FTA has directed reviewers to cite a deficiency when PM inspections are less than 80 percent on time.",

AVCOG must include with the submittal to the FTA regional office: \u2022 A report listing the dates the inspections are due and the dates of the actual inspections.
