In other words, recipients may not have any capacity constraints in the provision of ADA complementary paratransit service. A review of GBT's Operational Report and Management Dashboard documentation revealed capacity constraints in 2022. The report showed 1,332 denied/missed trips and less than a 50% on-time performance. During the follow up meeting, GBT explained that they experienced a severe shortage of qualified operators during and in the immediate post-pandemic period, which led to problems with capacity constraint metrics. It is also noted that GBT changed contractors in November 2021 to MV Transportation. Further analysis indicates that they have made progress through the establishment of a new position, the Director of Mobility on Demand, who is providing greater oversight of the contractor. GBT has also provided additional funding to enable MV Transportation to offer hiring bonuses and referral incentives. During a virtual meeting with MV Transportation, they reported that they are now fully staffed, and service constraints and indicators have improved.",
