This change require ratification by the SCTA Board and sufficient publication. 49 CFR 37.131 requires that the fare for a trip charged to an ADA paratransit eligible user of the complementary paratransit service shall not exceed twice the fare that would be charged to an individual paying full fare for a trip of similar length, at a similar time of day, on the entity's fixed route system.",
